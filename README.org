#+title: Rofi-pacman

Super simple rofi script to install packages from pacman (only, no AUR) and
remove local packages (including AUR ones).

To remove package, pass ~-r~ flag to the script.

To search package with regex, pass ~-R~ flag to the script, default is just a
fuzzy search.

A feature I personally found useful to have is *opeing package URL*,
which you can do with =Ctrl+o= default binding (feel free to change it in the
script manually, no config file needed).
